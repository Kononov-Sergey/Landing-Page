# First Static Landing Page

**Description:** It's a first landing page I've ever made. Actually, I was making this website along the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2zxQNQGcU8&ab_channel=%D0%9E%D1%820%D0%B4%D0%BE1), but I was using approach when you first of all watch the video and trying to repeat code by yourself, and after you run into some problem in your code you try to find a solution in a video.

The main point of this project was the practice HTML and CSS, and also I wanted to take a closer look at whole process of developing a real website from start to finish.
